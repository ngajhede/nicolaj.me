        I've been looking up to Peter Sunde since my young pirate days, and last
        week I watched a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC8wcy1NJEA" target="_blank"
          >fireside talk between Sofie Hvitved and Peter Sunde on youtube</a
        >, and I've been thinking about it ever since.

        The Tesla situation in Sweden is infuriating. It makes me mad when tech
        companies try to sidestep local labor practices, but I am proud of the
        reactions it got. Tesla has refused to sign collective agreements with
        Swedish unions, and now workers across different sectors are striking in
        solidarity.

        It's interesting how the world will dissect every tweet from Elon Musk,
        but often stays silent on these fundamental workplace issues that Tesla
        has.

        As software engineers, we have significant leverage that we rarely use
        to support workers with less privilege.

        There's a persistent idea in our industry that writing code is somehow
        politically neutral, but that's never been the case. The technologies we
        build, the companies we choose to work for, and the workplace conditions
        we accept are all inherently political choices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of us claim to be apolitical while working for companies whose
        business models and labor practices reflect very specific political
        viewpoints. This contradiction needs to be acknowledged more openly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strong labor protections can actually be a competitive advantage for
        tech companies. Better working conditions lead to better retention, more
        honest feedback, and ultimately better products.
      </p>

      <p>
        In places with a strong union tradition, developers can speak up about
        ethical concerns without fear of immediate retaliation. As we build
        increasingly powerful and potentially problematic technologies, this
        ability to raise concerns becomes even more crucial.
      </p>

      <p>
        Joining a union isn't just self-protection.. it's recognizing our
        responsibility to the community and society. For folks in Denmark, I can
        recommend
