          For some time, I have been sad about the direction my long-time
          favorite browser has been going.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last year, they
          <a
            href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/firefox-terms-of-use/"
            target="_blank"
            >started updating their terms of service</a
          >
          to give them more ownership over user data. They
          <a
            href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622080/mozilla-revising-firefox-terms-of-use-data"
            target="_blank"
            >quickly revised it again</a
          >, but I sadly lost a piece of trust for the Mozilla Foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later in the year, their newly appointed CEO announced that "Firefox
          will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software.
          Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI
          browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software
          additions."
        </p>

        <p>
          Aka.: more of the stuff the user base broadly doesn't want. At least
          not me.
        </p>

        <p>
          AI has once again been the big hype in 2025, while I have grown more
          critical and tired of hearing about it. I am very, <i>very</i> worried
          about the climate impact of all of the new AI datacenters popping up.
          Hearing stories of areas around the datacenters, totally drained of
          water. <strong>Edit:</strong> Apparently, the water usage thing was
          misinformation. Not sure what to think now.

          Anyways, I don't want AI in my browser, neither to use or to train on
          my data, so I decided to look for a new one.
        </p>

        <p>
          First thought was Librewolf, but I also stumbled upon
          <a href="https://vivaldi.com/" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a>: a
          Norway/Iceland based company, with a seemingly good, privacy-focused
          mission, built in tools to work with Proton, which I use for email,
          drive, VPN and calendar and a pledge to never implement AI features.
        </p>

        <p>
          My only worry was that it is Chromium-based, but after reading
          <a
            href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-different-from-chrome/"
            target="_blank"
            >their blogpost</a
          >
          regarding this, I feel much better about my choice.
        </p>

        <p>I will write a review later when I have used Vivaldi more.</p>
