          For as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by technology and
          the internet. As a kid, my grandfather taught me how to navigate the
          world wide web, showed memes sent via email and made me addicted to the
          game Frogger on DOS. I am forever grateful for that.

          My first "website" was me saving Jubii.dk (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubii"
            target="_blank"
            >legendary</a
          >, but closed, danish web portal) to a file on my PC, and editing it in
          a text editor. I made websites from that layout about my favorite
          childhood artist
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK0xyJbuVYM" target="_blank"
            >Razz</a
          >, a site with a collection of cool JavaScript effects (the analog clock
          around your cursor, anyone!?) and a site about the 2D avatar chat
          <a href="https://netstationen.dk" target="_blank">Netstationen</a>. I
          later started making cheat applications for the same chat in Visual
          Basic 6. Sorry!

          Much has happened since but my passion is just as strong. Today I work
          as a senior fullstack developer in the tech industry, building pretty
          cool platforms at ONLINECITY.IO.

          When I'm not tinkering with code, I enjoy spending time with my partner
          Ronja, <a href="/images/karsten.jpg">my cat Karsten</a> and advocating
          for a more ethical and human-centric internet. I believe in the power of
          technology to bring people together and making the world just a little
          better - not just stealing and exploiting user data for profit.
